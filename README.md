# Sets

1. Implement a missing set functionality in the package `set`.
   The set must be represented using `uint64` type:

   * `1` bit in the position `n` indicates that the number `n` is present in the set.
   * `0` bit in the position `n` indicates that the number `n` is not present in the set.

1. Demonstrate the set functionality in `main.go`, i.e. create and manipulate sets.

1. Add a file `set/set_test.go` and implement the tests there.
